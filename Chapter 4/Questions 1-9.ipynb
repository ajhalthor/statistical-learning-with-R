We examine a large number of companies and discover that the mean value of X for companies that issued a dividend was X ̄ = 10, while the mean for those that didn’t was X ̄ = 0. In addition, the variance of X for these two sets of companies was σˆ2 = 36. Finally, 80 % of companies issued dividends. Assuming that X follows a nor- mal distribution, predict the probability that a company will issue a dividend this year given that its percentage profit was X = 4 last year._\n",
